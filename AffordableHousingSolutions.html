    <h1>Affordable Housing Solutions</h1>
    <p>Our college should launch an app with the following solution options:</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>1. Architectural Solutions</h2>
    <p>Architectural design has remained a powerful tool for housing solutions over the years. Flexible architectural designs can be created to facilitate reconstruction in densely populated areas. This includes innovative clustering plans for high-rise buildings that utilize nearby resources efficiently, resulting in affordable housing options.</p>

    <h2>2. Government Solutions</h2>
    <p>Housing issues often require government intervention due to their scale. Governments can address this by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Motivating investors</li>
        <li>Controlling the influx of outsiders</li>
        <li>Allocating tax revenue to housing construction</li>
        <li>Developing clusters of towers</li>
        <li>Seeking expertise from other countries like Malaysia and Japan</li>
        <li>Enhancing education to deploy skilled professionals abroad, generating revenue through technical services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Communicational Solutions</h2>
    <p>Utilizing mass media and digital platforms, such as apps developed by NGOs or governments, can efficiently inform the public about available housing options. This ensures timely engagement and occupancy, contributing to community development.</p>

    <h2>4. Infrastructural Solutions</h2>
    <p>Identifying suitable land for housing construction, whether nearby or further away, is essential. Canada, with its vast land resources, can effectively utilize areas for housing construction, including innovative high-rise apartments.</p>

    <h2>5. Deep Learning for Housing Solutions</h2>
    <p>The advancements in information technology, particularly in AI through deep learning, offer promising solutions. By analyzing nationwide data, segmenting it geographically, and employing deep learning techniques, optimal housing solutions can be identified and provided, leveraging the power of technology.</p>
